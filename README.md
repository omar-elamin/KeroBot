# KeroBot - (OUTDATED)
Kero Discord Bot

**Information**

Prefix: ,

Contributers:
 - elmon
 - speed
 
Just a bot I made in my spare time it includes some neat features like ,muteall <voicechannel> that allows you to server mute everyone for games like among us etc.
You can dm me on discord for custom features you want added to it @ elmon#0001
  
You need the lavalink.jar in the cogs/music directory and have it running when the bot is launched for music to work.
